# Changelog

- 0.4.0 (2025-12-27)
  * Switches from variable-size 'Integer' to fixed-width words and
    constant-time primitives supplied by ppad-fixed. The implementation now
    runs about 25x faster and in time constant with respect to secrets.

- 0.3.0 (2025-06-21)
  * The 'mac' function is now total, returning 'Nothing' when supplied
    with an invalid-length one-time key.

- 0.2.0 (2025-03-10)
  * Fix a bug in which small produced MAC's were not being padded to 128
    bits.

- 0.1.0 (2025-03-09)
  * Initial release, supporting the Poly1305 MAC.
